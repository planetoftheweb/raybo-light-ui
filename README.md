# Solarized Light UI theme

When I used Sublime Text, I had my own version of the [solarized] theme because I wanted to improve on it's contrast a bit and add some markdown features. I wanted to duplicate that in Atom, so I found a great UI theme from [Pierrezoux] and decided to tweak it from there for my own use.

Based on [Solarized Dark UI] Atom theme. This is a fork of [Pierrezoux]
